# Enhancing Visual Speech Recognition with Language Models
By Sofia Dominguez (domingc7@mit.edu) and Daria Kryvosheieva (daria_k@mit.edu)

This project fine-tuned <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10096889">Auto-AVSR</a> on two additional datasets (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7050271">TCD-TIMIT</a> + <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10483898">WildVSR</a>) and experimented with integrating a language model into the beam search decoding process.
